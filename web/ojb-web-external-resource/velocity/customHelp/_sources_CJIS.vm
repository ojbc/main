<p><b>CRIMINAL HISTORY:</b></p>

The Statewide criminal justice information system provides access to adult Criminal History records.
<br/><br/>
There are 2 levels of access to these records:
<ul>
	<li>
		Conviction Only
		<p>
			This information is available to the public, and as such it will be visible to all OJBC Portal users. Covered in this data set are all convictions.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Full RAP
		<p>
			The full Record of Arrests data set is only available to authorized employees. The user will be able to see convictions, as well as arrests pending a final disposition and arrests resulting in dismissals and other non-convictions. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Expungement data is currently not included in the full rap records.  This is a planned future enhancement.
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>

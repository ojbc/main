		<h2>Firearm Search Parameters</h2>
		
		<br/><br/>
		<h3>SERIAL NUMBER</h3>
		This is the Factory-specific Serial Number, and as such, there is no specific format that this parameter follows.
		<br/><br/>
		The user may select "Includes" which will search for the specific string anywhere within existing serial numbers. For example, searching for '111' with the "Includes" option will return '...111', '...111...', '111', and '111...' entries. Using the "Exact Match" option will only return the specific string searched for. So '111' searches with the "Exact Match" option will only return registrations with '111' as the serial number.
		<h3>REGISTRATION NUMBER</h3>
		This number should be unique for each county.
		<br/><br/>
		For Maui County, this number seems to be digits-only, 2-5 digits in length.
		<h3>County</h3>
		This field is currently not functional, and is going to be removed in a future version of the Portal.
		<h3>MAKE/MODEL</h3>
		These fields functions as if an "Includes" option was selected. This allows users to search for a specific maker (i.e. "REMINGTON ARMS CO., INC." will return a smaller, easier to search list of matches than "REMINGTON"), or use a broad search ("ARMS") to return a large list and then attempt to use subsequent searches to filter down further.
		<h3>Firearm Type</h3>
		This field is meant to allow users to filter large result sets based on the type of firearm (e.g. pistol, rifle, shotgun).

		<p><b>CRIMINAL HISTORY:</b></p>
		
		The Statewide criminal justice information system provides access to adult Criminal History records.
		<br/><br/>
		There are 2 levels of access to these records:
		<ul>
		    <li>
		        Conviction Only
		        <p>
		            This information is available to the public, and as such it will be visible to all OJBC Portal users. Covered in this data set are all convictions.
		        </p>
		    </li>
		    <li>
		        Full RAP
		        <p>
		            The full Record of Arrests data set is only available to authorized employees. The user will be able to see convictions, as well as arrests pending a final disposition and arrests resulting in dismissals and other non-convictions. 
		        </p>
		        <p>
		            Expungement data is currently not included in the full rap records.  This is a planned future enhancement.
		        </p>
		    </li>
		</ul>
